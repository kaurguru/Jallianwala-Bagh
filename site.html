<font size="6"><b><p>The entrance to Jallianwala Bagh is via a narrow passage, the same passage that was the only entry 
and exit point at the time of the massacre and the same route that General Dyer and his troops took to reach the grounds.
At the entrance is a statue of Udham Singh. Once entered, some old trees can be seen in the garden with some buildings at the back.
 With the words 'Vande Mataram', a flame titled Amar Jyoti (Eternal Flame) is seen burning to the right under a domed meditation area.

The wall has its own historic significance as it has thirty-six bullet marks which can be easily seen at present and these 
were fired into the crowd by the order of General Dyer. Moreover, no warning was given to disperse before Dyer opened fire
 which was gathered here against the Rowlatt Act. One Thousand Six Hundred and Fifty Rounds were fired .<br><br>

<font size="5"><b><p>The well in Jallianwala Bagh is known as the Martyr's Well and is a significant part of the Jallianwala 
Bagh memorial in Amritsar, Punjab, India. The well is a solemn reminder of the tragic Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took place 
there on April 13, 1919. It is believed that many people jumped into the well to escape the firing by British Indian Army troops. The 
well is still preserved and can be visited by tourists as a symbol of the sacrifices made by Indian nationalists in the struggle for
 independence. Over 120 bodies were pulled out of the well after the massacre. Today, the Jallianwala Bagh is a national monument
 and a popular tourist destination in India.
