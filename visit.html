<b><font size=5><p><br>Jallianwala Bagh is a public garden in Amritsar, Punjab, India, that is well-known for its historical significance. 
It is a place that draws tourists from all over the world because of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre that occurred there in 1919. This incident 
is considered a turning point in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule.</p>

<p>On April 13, 1919, a peaceful gathering of people, including men, women, and children, had assembled in Jallianwala Bagh to protest
 against the arrest of two leaders of the Indian National Congress. However, General Reginald Dyer, the British army officer in charge of
 Amritsar at the time, ordered his troops to open fire on the unarmed crowd, resulting in the death of hundreds of innocent civilians.</p><br><br>

<p>Today, Jallianwala Bagh is a national memorial and serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for India's
 independence. The garden has been preserved as it was at the time of the massacre, with bullet holes still visible in the walls. The
 Martyrs' Well, where many people jumped to escape the firing, is also preserved as a memorial.</p>

<p>Tourists can visit Jallianwala Bagh to pay their respects to the victims of the massacre and to learn about the history of India's
 struggle for independence. The garden is open to visitors every day, and there is no entry fee. The best time to visit is during the 
spring or winter months, as summers in Amritsar can be quite hot.</p></font></b>
