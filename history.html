<p><b><font size="5">The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre took place on <mark>13th April 1919</mark> on the day of Baisakhi when a large group 
of men, women and children unaware of the martial law decided to assemble in the park. The peaceful protest was organised against the Rowlatt
 Act and the wrongful arrest of Congress leaders in India.  Without any warning, <a href ="generaldyer.html">General Dyer</a> ordered its men 
to block all entrances and to open fire on the peaceful gathering. This massacre took<mark> 400 civilian lives and injured 1200</mark>. 

The incident created a rift between the Indian people and the British government. Despite a massive outcry, no action was taken against the
 perpetrators of the heinous crime. The massacre at Amritsar was a turning point in the Indian national movement as the moderate leaders lost
 faith in the fairness of the British regime. The Hunter Commission was set up to investigate the event and condemned the actions of General 
Dyer yet no concrete punishment was issued against the General behind the most brutal killings in modern India.

The massacre permanently scarred relations between India and Britain and was the prelude to Mahatma Gandhi  noncooperation movement
 of 1920-22.</font></b></p><br><br>

<font size=5><b><p>The 7-acre (28,000 m2) site is located in the vicinity of the Golden Temple complex.
Jallianwala Bagh or the garden of the Jallah-man, with its well, implies that it was once green and flowering.Over the years it had become
 popular as a recreation ground and an area of rest for those visiting the nearby Golden temple.In 1919, it was a dried-out plot, surrounded 
by tightly packed multi-occupancy buildings dividend by some narrow streets, and having only one entrance and exit route. It was unoccupied 
and surrounded by a wall.The place derives its name from the Pandit Jalla.</p></b></font>

<font size=5><b><p>In 1919, in response to excluding Mahatma Gandhi from visiting Punjab, the secret deportation of Saifuddin Kitchlew and
 Satyapal on 10 April and the reactions to the Rowlatt Act, Punjab had witnessed attempts of Indians to gather and protest.[1] On the morning 
of Baisakhi, 13 April 1919, to the sound of military drums by the cities town criers, 19 locations around the city were read out <mark>Brigadier 
General R.E.H. Dyer's </mark>new rules.[1] He had placed restrictions on leaving the city without a permit, banned all "processions of any 

kind"and any congregation of more than four people, and announced around the city that "any person found in the streets after 8 pm will be
 shot" The announcements came at a time of noise and unusual heat, and missed key locations around the city, so that they were not widely 
disseminated.Dyer was subsequently informed at <mark>12.40 pm</mark> that day that a political gathering was to be held at Jallianwala 
Bagh. By the time Dyer arrived with 90 Sikh, Gurkha, Baloch, Rajput troops from 2-9th Gurkhas, <mark>the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles,
 there was a crowd of 20,000; a mix of speakers, listeners, picnic-makers, men, women and children of all ages, including Hindus, Sikhs,
 Muslims and Christians.General Dyer then ordered his troops to fire at the crowds.1,650 rounds were fired and the number, killing and
 injuring many; the numbers are disputed.</p></b></font>
