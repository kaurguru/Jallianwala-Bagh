<b><font size="5"><p>General Reginald Dyer (1864-1927) was a British Army officer best known for his role in the Jallianwala Bagh
 massacre in 1919, in which British Indian Army troops under his command opened fire on a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians, killing
 hundreds and injuring thousands.

Dyer believed that the use of force was necessary to maintain British control over India and preserve the empire, and he saw the
 massacre as a necessary response to growing Indian nationalist sentiment and unrest.

However, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre was widely condemned both in India and internationally, and Dyer was eventually relieved
 of his command and forced to retire from the army. He became a controversial figure, with some British conservatives hailing him as
 a hero and others condemning him as a brutal and unjust oppressor.</p></font></font><br><br>
<font color="purple"><h1> Rawlt Act</h1></font>

<p><b><font size="5">The Rowlatt Act, also known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, was a controversial law passed
 by the British colonial government in India in 1919, in the aftermath of the First World War and the nonviolent civil disobedience movement 
led by Mahatma Gandhi.

The law gave the colonial government sweeping powers to arrest and detain anyone suspected of political dissent without trial and for an 
indefinite period of time. It also restricted civil liberties, such as freedom of the press and assembly.

The Rowlatt Act was met with widespread protests and strikes in India, with many Indians seeing it as a betrayal of the promises of self-rule 
made by the British during the war. The protests eventually culminated in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which further fueled nationalist 
sentiment and demands for independence.

The Rowlatt Act was eventually repealed in 1922, but its legacy remained an important symbol of colonial oppression and resistance in 
India's struggle for independence.</font></b></p>
